  <h1>Noam's World</h1>
  </p> Noam is a young artist. He goes through various phases in rather quick sequence. 
       Now it is a rather disturbing, (he means magical) creatures phase.
       He loves reading books about dragons, Vikings, and not so heroic heroes, and then Noam draws them.</p>
  <aside>
    <p>Hiccup had always been an unremarkable-looking boy for a Viking Hero, with one of those ordinary faces that was difficult to remember.
      But now he was a truly pitiable sight, like a broken scarecrow that someone has accidentally trodden on. 
      An odd sort of Hero, for the worst crisis humanity has ever faced.
